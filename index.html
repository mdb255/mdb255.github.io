  <p>Hi, my name is Mike Baldwin and I'm a student in the Web Design track at the summer session of Startup Institute. I'm very excited to have this opportunity to help me transition into web development and find a position at a company where I can solve problems I really care about! I'm originally from South Shore MA, and currently living in Quincy. In my spare time I enjoy photography, badminton, board games, and trying new foods!</p>
